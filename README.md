# Brain-Tester
Brain Tester android application is a **basic brain training game**, which will be asking the user to calculate the answer to various simple arithmetic expressions depending on the user selected game difficulty level from one of the main screens. As well as this one of my very first projects which I completed during my second year(Level 05) mobile applicaation development module at IIT.

Following picture is showing the main screens of this **Brain-Tester** game.

The first screen shows the **splash screen** of my game and I added a progress bar and logo to make it looks better. Second screen presents the user 4 buttons labelled **New Game, Continue, About and Exit** as the main game menu screen.

For further user can perform following tasks using the menu screen(Second Screen).
* Clicking on the **New Game button**, starts a new game for the user.
* Clicking on the **Continue button**, a previously started game is resumed. The game resumes from exactly the same point that it was left before.
* Clicking on the **About button**, it presents the user with a popup window which describes the rules of the game.
* Clicking on the **Exit button**, terminates the application.

Following image shows the other screens which I have developed to complete this project.
